# Thunderbolt 3 Unblocker

This project provides a kernel extension that unblocks unsupported Thunderbolt
3 peripherals (such as the Razer Core) on macOS.

This accomplishes the same goal as [KhaosT's TB3 Enabler][tb3-enabler], which
works by patching IOThunderboltFamily on disk. This kernel extension performs
the patch in memory and on-the-fly.

[tb3-enabler]: https://github.com/KhaosT/tb3-enabler

Note there is likely a reason why IOThunderboltFamily considers a peripheral
unsupported in the first place. Use at your own peril.

This kernel extension was last tested against macOS High Sierra 10.13.4. Please
check for [open issues][issues] before using on newer versions.

## Installation

To prepare your development environment, please run

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    brew install cmake

Build the project with Xcode. Make sure to change code signing settings as
appropriate.

Load the kernel extension with:

    sudo chown -R root:wheel Thunderbolt3Unblocker.kext
    sudo kextload Thunderbolt3Unblocker.kext

If loading the kext fails: Reboot into the Recovery Partition and disable kext
security restrictions using `csrutil enable --without kext`.

## `xnu_override`

This project also implements a simple, reusable in-memory kernel patching
library. The author has released it under a permissive license in the hopes
that it will be useful.
